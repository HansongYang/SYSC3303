Assignment Requirement:

1.Three logical processes P, Q, and S have the following characteristics: P: period 3, required execution time 1; Q: period 6, required
execution time 3, S: period 18, required execution time 2. 
a.Show how these processes can be scheduled using the rate monotonic scheduling algorithm. 
b.Show how a cyclic executive could be constructed to implement the three logical processes. 

2.Consider three processes P, Q, and S. P has a period of 100 ms in which it requires 15 ms of processing.
 The corresponding values for Q and S are (5, 1) and (25, 10) respectively. 
a.What is the processor utilization of P, Q, and S? 
b.If the processes were scheduled by a cyclic executive, would they meet their deadlines? Explain your answer. 
c.If the processes were scheduled using the rate monotonic scheduling algorithm, would they meet their deadlines? Explain your answer. 

3.The process set shown here is not schedulable using the Liu/Layland utilization test but does meet all its deadlines. Explain why. 
Process	      Period	   Execution Time
  P1		70		30
  P2		40		10
  P3		20		 5
