# Sysc-3303-Assignments

These are all the assignments in SYSC 3303. Read the Readme file in each assignment folder first and then open the Java files. 
Remember, don't copy them all over. Read codes line by line, understand them and make some changes, because there could be a lot of people read these things. Think about it!

By the way, don't thank me, thank God!!!
