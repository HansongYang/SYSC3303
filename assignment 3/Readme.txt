Assignment Requirement:
Part 1
Select an article or articles (newspaper, magazine, web, book chapter, etc.) on a topic related to the course. Real-time concurrent systems is a
very broad subject, so pick something that interests you, and preferably something recent. Subject areas from previous terms included automotive
design progress (self-driving cars, collisions avoidance systems, etc.), aerospace and aircraft evolution (Mars Rover, radar, drones), real-time
system issues (Heartbleed bug, SIM heist, medical hacking, patriot missile failure), real-time system developments (garbage collection, RTOS, 
real-time databases), and advances in concurrency (multi-threading, hyper-threading, designing systems for concurrency, thread issues). 
If you need assistance in choosing a topic, just ask.

Part 2
Once your article (or articles) has/have been approved, you are to write a summary of the article(s). Your summary (one single pdf file) 
should be at least five pages in length (double-spaced). If you are able to relate your topic to anything discussed in the lectures, that 
is excellent, but not required. Be sure to put your name and student number on your submission, and include all the details of your resource(s)
 (author, title, URL or publisher, date) in a "References" section at the end of your summary.
